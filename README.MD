## Create Data Connection for Event Grid
Create a new ADX table, this can be done either via the UI or using the script in this repo (as an example)

In your ADX Database, create a new data connection for the Event Grid created earlier

Missed from the earlier screenshot, be sure to add the correct mapping file as well

Upload the second file and the Event Grid should load the data for the ADX DB

Wait five minutes and you should see traffic against the event hub

Check the table you created and you should see more data in the table now
